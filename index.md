## Bio
Graduated in 2019 in Environmental and Sanitary Engineering from the Federal University of the 
Southern Border (UFFS), where she worked in the field of Sanitary Engineering, with an emphasis 
on Bioremediation, working mainly on the topics of soil treatment by natural attenuation, 
bioaugmentation and biostimulation. In addition, she also worked with biological degradation of 
feathers for the production of hydrolysates. She was an intern at the company Genética GROUP -
Environmental Technologies, acquiring experience in the area of domestic and industrial effluent 
treatment, with emphasis on electrocoagulation and bioremediation tests in ponds. She studied 
for a master's degree in Environmental and Sanitary Engineering at the Federal University of 
Santa Maria (UFSM), where she carried out effluent treatment projects by Advanced Oxidative 
Processes (AOPs) - photo-Fenton. The objective of her research was the development of new and 
efficient photo-catalysts supported in biochar produced with industrial residues. In the second 
half of 2019, she was selected to undertake an exchange program at the National Autonomous 
University of México (UNAM), subsidized by the German EXCEED-Swindon program, for three 
months, where she carried out research and exchanged techniques and knowledge about AOPs 
between Brazil and Mexico. She is currently pursuing her PhD in the Department of Civil and 
Environmental Engineering at the University of Rhode Island, and her research is focused on 
use of Microbial Electrolysis Cells for domestic wastewater treatment and simultaneous 
production of biohydrogen. She also carried out a summer project where she treated and 
analyzed the wastewater of a squid processing plant using electro-oxidation.
